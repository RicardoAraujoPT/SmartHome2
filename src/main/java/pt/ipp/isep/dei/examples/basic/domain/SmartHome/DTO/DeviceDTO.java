/**
 * The DeviceDTO class represents a Data Transfer Object (DTO) for a device in the SmartHomeProject.
 * It encapsulates the device's name, active status, and lists of associated sensors and actuators.
 * The class provides methods to get these attributes.
 * <p>
 * The DeviceDTO class interacts with the following classes:
 * - Sensor: The DeviceDTO class has a list of Sensor names.
 * - Actuator: The DeviceDTO class has a list of Actuator names.
 * <p>
 * The name of the device is a string that cannot be null or empty.
 * <p>
 * The device ID is a unique identifier for the device generated when the device is created and used to identify it in
 * the system. It is a string and cannot be null or empty. It is immutable and cannot be changed after it is set.
 * <p>
 * The active status is a boolean that represents whether the device is currently active or not.
 * <p>
 * The list of sensors is a list of Sensor names that are associated with the device.
 * <p>
 * The list of actuators is a list of Actuator names that are associated with the device.
 * <p>
 * Usage:
 * Creating a device DTO:
 * DeviceDTO deviceDTO = new DeviceDTO(deviceName, isActive, sensors, actuators);
